                  <h2>FestiFall Survival Guide</h2>
                  <p>With FestiFall a few months down the line, we're sure you're getting excited and making travel plans to get here. For seasoned pros you’ll know the drill. But for those of you who haven’t been before, take a look at what we advise you bring along to have the best amount of fun.</p>
                  <strong>Fun hat</strong>
                  <p>This is the only time of the year where you can wear a ridiculously stupid hat and feel perfectly normal. Make the most of this grand opportunity.</p>
                  <strong>Camera, of the disposable type</strong>
                  <p>One of the best parts of a festival is when you're picking up the films the following week, the person behind the counter must be in fits of laughter! Mind you, given the scenery and gorgeous northern lights, bringing a professional grade camera is a bit of a risk!</p>
                  <strong>Anorak</strong>
                  <p>The chance of rain is usually pretty high, and if not, keep warm! It is practically the north pole!</p>
                  <strong>2 pairs of shoes/wellies</strong>
                  <p>If you've ever been to a festival or campsite, you know you won't be wearing those shoes again. The festival site is on mother nature, there will be mud, and lots of it!</p>
                  <strong>Snacks</strong>
                  <p>Need we say more? There will be kiosks and venues stationed around selling food and refreshments, but nothing is better than a snack-feast when you've spent the day running around FestiFall.</p>
